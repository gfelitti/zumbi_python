\f0\fs24 \cf0 I first learned to code at age 16, and am now in my 30s. I have a math PhD from Duke. I still remember my pride in a knights tour algorithm that I wrote in C in high school; the awesome mind warp of an interpreter that can interpret itself (a Scheme course my first semester of college) my fascination with numerous types of matrix factorizations in C in grad school; and my excitement about relational databases and web scrapers in my first real job.\

Over a decade after I first learned to program, I still loved algorithms, but felt alienated and depressed by tech culture. While at a company that was a particularly poor culture fit, I was so unhappy that I hired a career counselor to discuss alternative career paths. Leaving tech would have been devastating, but staying was tough.}
